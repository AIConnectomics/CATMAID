Tools
=====

CATMAID includes a set of tools to navigate, share and annotate large
image data sets. These tools often contain some control elements to
modify certain parameters. This could e.g. be sliders, buttons or input
boxes. Most of the controls offer various ways for changing a value
and so sliders and input boxes can be changed with the help of the mouse
wheel, small buttons or direct input.

Navigation
----------

The navigation tool makes it easy to browse a data set. It allows you to
specify the center of the current view and provides controls to change the
current slice and zoom level. Keep in mind that a zoom-level defines how
often the images dimension get divided by two (i.e. dim/2^zoom). A change
of these controls will redraw the current view.

Clicking and dragging the view with the mouse can be used to move around
on the current slice.
