TODO


BEAUTIFICATION
* arrowheads problem (zindex)
* drag treenodes updates connector path
* code-cleanup
* catmaid.org, tutorial, video
  * small tutorial with the key bindings and how tracing works
  * homepage: "try it now": a test project with images and
    segmentations were anybody can add text labels, and edit just about
    anything. A cron job can reset it every hour or so, or each visitor is
    given a copy of the segmentation data 

WISHLIST
* zoom in past 100%, on to 200% and 400% (MHL can work on this)
* in TrakEM2, pressing 'g' while over a node selects that object - in
  CATMAID it would be good if it selected the active node.
* once display is fast enough, display treelines in all modes - in
  general
* search box (regular expression across class instance names)
* somewhere that displays the world coordinates of the current mouse position
* PROBLEM: dblick just somewhere to zoom in in all modes
  * why can not set ondblclick event handler to mouse catcher?

LATER
* Benchmarks / speedup investigation
* security auditing, related to:
  - amazon mechanical turk test
  - user rights managment, registration
  - history/logfile of changes
* 3d view of a skeleton
* show connectivity graph from annotation domain
* integrate the window manager: CMW
* ontology work
  - import obo ontolgoy terms
  - use class_class for constraining
* export script to trackem
* new django-based back-end (MHL working on this)
* label an area by a close polyline, similar to labelme
  - add a areatreenode inheriting from treenode with array column
* OPEN: add connector table (id, x,y,z, presyn, postsyn, tags, lastmodified)

SECURITY CONCERNS
* problem of SQL injections in php where REQUEST variable is just used in the sql statements
* calling e.g. tracing methods programatically in firebug using the project variable
* php code execution protected only by if($pid) and if($uid)

DONE
* DONE: change confidence value (-> in table)
* DONE: active treenode in view, show its skeleton treenodes in datatable
* DONE: show treenodes from a given skeleton again (check again from object tree)
* DONE: splitting seems not to update the skeleton correctly
* DONE: add endnode types to treenode, was leaf node
* DONE: ctrl check for tagging
* DONE:colorcode active treenode in data table
  * also colorcoded root and leaf node
* DONE: delete active treenode problem (when new node added)
DONE
* copying sliders instead of moving them
  zoom-level scroll bar not visible with "move" or "select" tools.
  -> DONE
* update schema.dia file: DONE
* add keyboard shortcuts (like F2, F3, F4 ...) for all the tools in the toolbar.
  --> added keybindings with 1,2,3,...
* context popup menu in the "Object Tree" doesn't go away when moving the mouse out of it, or when
  clicking elsewhere. One must click on one of its elements. -> only does not go away when clicking on the stack
* Tagging must be easier/faster: keyboard only. -> now, automatic focus on input
  field to start typing, automatic tag addition when entering seperator (,)
  store tags with Tab-Space (switch to save button end click), if required
  you can add another key that simulates a .click() event
* check delete connector when active (probably need to deactivate as well): DONE
* too may neurons in Fragments. a folder for real fragments without single postsynaptic nodes
  -> now, adding in "Fragments" for newly created treenodes just somewhere, and 
  "Fragments with connector" for added postsynaptic single treenodes
* object tree background alignment in chrome
  -> back to classic
* added indices to master.sql
