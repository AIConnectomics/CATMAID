TODO

* OPEN: too may neurons in Fragments. a folder for real fragments without single postsynaptic nodes
  * PROBLEM: create new postyn treenode, and the, continue tracing, would stay in the same group
* PROBLEM: dblick just somewhere to zoom in in all modes
  * why can not set ondblclick event handler to mouse catcher?
* OPEN: add connector table (id, x,y,z, presyn, postsyn, tags, lastmodified)
* CANT REPRODUCE: sEcho error for in datatable for vnc stack
* check delete connector when active (probably need to deactivate as well)
* zoom-level scroll bar not visible with "move" or "select" tools.
  
* Rendering when zoomed into 100% is not limited to 400 nodes. Some
nodes get rendered and some don't. MMB-drag updates different subsets at
every repaint event.
* JPEG artifacts: CATMAID shows jpeg images, which were generated from
TrakEM2's jpeg mimaps. One step of jpeg-ing too many. We should generate
CATMAID tiles from original images plus their transformations. How did
you generate the tiles for the VNC? If from TrakEM2, I can fix that
part.
 I am not sure I understood
the logic. The current interface is pretty, and lets one add more than
one tag at the same time. I'd rather enter just one tag by 't', type,
up/down arrows to choose, enter to select, enter to set. Or just 't',
type, enter to set (can be faster to type "TODO" than to scroll for it).

... also sometimes I get into state where "Cannot find skeleton
for parent treenode in this project" errors happen whenever I
click in the interface

DONE

* context popup menu in the "Object Tree" doesn't go away when moving the mouse out of it, or when
  clicking elsewhere. One must click on one of its elements. -> only does not go away when clicking on the stack
* Tagging must be easier/faster: keyboard only. -> now, automatic focus on input
  field to start typing, automatic tag addition when entering seperator (,)
  store tags with Tab-Space (switch to save button end click), if required
  you can add another key that simulates a .click() event

BEAUTIFICATION
* arrowheads problem (zindex)
* drag treenodes updates connector path
* code-cleanup
* catmaid.org, tutorial, video
  * small tutorial with the key bindings and how tracing works
* remove beta from title?
* object tree background alignment in chrome
* copying sliders instead of moving them
* splitter in toolbar
* update schema.dia file
* add keyboard shortcuts (like F2, F3, F4 ...) for all the tools in the toolbar.


WISHLIST

* zoom in past 100%, on to 200% and 400% (MHL can work on this)
* in TrakEM2, pressing 'g' while over a node selects that object - in
  CATMAID it would be good if it selected the active node.
* once display is fast enough, display treelines in all modes - in
  general
* search box (regular expression across class instance names)
* somewhere that displays the world coordinates of the current mouse
  position
* homepage: "try it now": a test project with images and
segmentations were anybody can add text labels, and edit just about
anything. A cron job can reset it every hour or so, or each visitor is
given a copy of the segmentation data 


LATER
* security auditing, related to:
  - amazon mechanical turk test
  - user rights managment, registration
  - history/logfile of changes
* 3d view of a skeleton
* show connectivity graph from annotation domain
* integrate the window manager: CMW
* ontology work
  - import obo ontolgoy terms
  - use class_class for constraining
* export script to trackem
* new django-based back-end (MHL working on this)
* label an area by a close polyline, similar to labelme
  - add a areatreenode inheriting from treenode with array column

SECURITY CONCERNS
* problem of SQL injections in php where REQUEST variable is just used in the sql statements
* calling e.g. tracing methods programatically in firebug using the project variable
* php code execution protected only by if($pid) and if($uid)

DONE
* DONE: change confidence value (-> in table)
* DONE: active treenode in view, show its skeleton treenodes in datatable
* DONE: show treenodes from a given skeleton again (check again from object tree)
* DONE: splitting seems not to update the skeleton correctly
* DONE: add endnode types to treenode, was leaf node
* DONE: ctrl check for tagging
* DONE:colorcode active treenode in data table
  * also colorcoded root and leaf node
* DONE: delete active treenode problem (when new node added)
