TOMORROW
- user managment extensions, plans
- tracing policy/best practics (lower/uppercase names, tags, where to place the treenode/connector)
- catmaid.org, tutorial, video
  * small tutorial with the key bindings and how tracing works
  * homepage: "try it now": a test project with images and
    segmentations were anybody can add text labels, and edit just about
    anything. A cron job can reset it every hour or so, or each visitor is
    given a copy of the segmentation data

critical
- remove a root node with children does delete the skeleton element of relationship of all its children
- several label refresh calls when panning -> in stack.js line 613, textlabel redraw logic
- show all links for a connector even when not in the same slice
- show all incoming connectors for each treenode

important
- add transactions to the operations
- reverse the ordering of drawing the line
- show skeleton in object tree for a selected treenode / shortcut to display the selected neuron in the object tree
- highlight the active skeleton
- not updating nodes quickly when moving through stack. only update nodes at final point when scrolling.

wishlist
- show z coordinat in statusbar when panning
- not use ctrl-click for deselect 
- datatable, label to the left, type small, do not need to show the id
- zoom in/out should use mouse position
- show the confidence for active treenodes/connector
- updating the confidence with keys 1 to 5
- ability to pop out interface elements -> window manager
- Bug: On mac chrome v9, sometimes tiles don't load on zoom/layer change operations and lack of loading persists. No issues with scrolling.
- zoom in past 100%, on to 200% and 400% (MHL can work on this)
- Turn scale bar off option
- Bug: [+] expander box is shown even on elements without subobjects in Object Tree
- in TrakEM2, pressing 'g' while over a node selects that object - in
  CATMAID it would be good if it selected the active node.
- once display is fast enough, display treelines in all modes - in general
- search box (regular expression across class instance names)
- somewhere that displays the world coordinates of the current mouse position
- dblick just somewhere to zoom in in all modes

LATER
* Benchmarks / speedup investigation
* shift-click on a line should add a node between two others
* security auditing, related to:
  - amazon mechanical turk test
  - user rights managment, registration
  - history/logfile of changes
* 3d view of a skeleton
* show connectivity graph from annotation domain
* integrate the window manager: CMW
* ontology work
  - import obo ontolgoy terms
  - use class_class for constraining
* export script to trackem
* new django-based back-end (MHL working on this)
* label an area by a close polyline, similar to labelme
  - add a areatreenode inheriting from treenode with array column
* add connector table (id, x,y,z, presyn, postsyn, tags, lastmodified)
