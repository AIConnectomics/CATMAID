critical

important
- reverse the ordering of drawing the line
- tracing policy/best practics (lower/uppercase names, tags, where to place the treenode/connector)
- catmaid.org, tracing tutorial, video, try it now project online
- several label refresh calls when panning -> in stack.js line 613, textlabel redraw logic
- show all links for a connector even when not in the same slice
- show all incoming connectors for a treenode
- highlight treenode of currently activated skeleton (will probably require to fetch the skeletons ids and
  save it as property of the nodes)
- delete only the connection to or from a treenode when you click on the arrow
- update the datatable/treeview after operations: create/delete/join/split/reroot treenode
- add transactions to the operations
- show skeleton in object tree for a selected treenode / shortcut to display the selected neuron in the object tree
- not updating nodes quickly when moving through stack. only update nodes at final point when scrolling.

wishlist
- not use ctrl-click for deselect 
- datatable, label to the left, type small, do not need to show the id
- zoom in/out should use mouse position
- show the confidence for active treenodes/connector
- updating the confidence with keys 1 to 5
- ability to pop out interface elements -> window manager
- Bug: On mac chrome v9, sometimes tiles don't load on zoom/layer change operations and
  lack of loading persists. No issues with scrolling.
- zoom in past 100%, on to 200% and 400%
- Turn scale bar off option
- Bug: [+] expander box is shown even on elements without subobjects in Object Tree
- in TrakEM2, pressing 'g' while over a node selects that object - in CATMAID it would
  be good if it selected the active node
- once display is fast enough, display treelines in all modes - in general
- search box (regular expression across class instance names)
- somewhere that displays the world coordinates of the current mouse position
- dblick just somewhere to zoom in in all modes
- shift-click on a line should add a node between two others

LATER
- benchmarks / speedup investigation
- user rights management extensions
- security auditing, related to:
  - amazon mechanical turk test
  - user rights managment, registration
  - history/logfile of changes
- 3d view of a skeleton
- show connectivity graph from annotation domain
- integrate the window manager: CMW
- ontology work: import/export obo ontolgoy terms, use class_class for constraining
- export script to trackem
- new django-based back-end
- label an area by a close polyline, similar to labelme
  - add a areatree node inheriting from treenode with array column
- add connector table (id, x,y,z, presyn, postsyn, tags, lastmodified)
