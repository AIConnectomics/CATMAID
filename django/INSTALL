# Installing the neuron catalogue

Make sure that you have the following packages installed:

  sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv libpq-dev python-dev

You first need to create a Python virtualenv.  In this directory, run:

   virtualenv --no-site-packages env

Then run:

   source env/bin/activate

... to activate the virtualenv environment.  Then install the packages
at the right versions:

   pip install -r pip-frozen

If you want to be able to run the unit tests, you will need to allow
the catmaid database user (catmaid_user by default) to create new
databases.  You can do that with:

   postgres=# ALTER USER catmaid_user CREATEDB;
   ALTER ROLE

... and you should also add this line at the top of

    /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf local test_catmaid catmaid_user md5

... and then restart PostgreSQL:

    /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.4 restart

Now copy settings.py.example to settings.py and edit it in the
following ways:

  * Set SECRET_KEY to a new value, as suggested in the comment.

  * Change the absolute path in TEMPLATE_DIRS to wherever the
    templates directory in this repository.

  * Change the STATICFILES_URL and STATICFILES_LOCAL variables to
    point to the right locations.

Try running the server locally, with:

  ./manage.py runserver

... and visiting http://localhost:8000/[project_id]

If that works successfully, carry on to configure Apache.

## Apache

First, install the wsgi Apache module:

   sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi

Now copy settings_apache.py.example to settings_apache.py, and
customize that file.  Similarly, copy django.wsgi.example to
django.wsgi and customize that file.

Then you need to edit your Apache configuration to point to that WSGI
file and set up the appropriate aliases.  An example is given here:

    Alias /catmaid/dj-static/ /home/mark/catmaid-local-instance/django/static/

    Alias /catmaid/dj /home/mark/catmaid-local-instance/django/mysite/django.wsgi
    <Location /catmaid/dj>
            SetHandler wsgi-script
            Options +ExecCGI
    </Location>

    Alias /catmaid/ /home/mark/catmaid-local-instance/httpdocs/

    <Directory /home/mark/catmaid-local-instance/httpdocs/>

            php_admin_value register_globals off
            php_admin_value include_path ".:/home/mark/catmaid-local-instance/inc"
            php_admin_value session.use_only_cookies 1
            php_admin_value error_reporting 2047
            php_admin_value display_errors true

            Options FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit FileInfo
            Order deny,allow
            Allow from all

    </Directory>
